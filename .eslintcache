Over the course of my five year degree I plan on exploring\n            various different fields in engineering and tech to diversify my\n            skill set. Currently, I am on the Industry 4.0 design team, where I\n            am a web development team member. I work with HTML and CSS, more\n            specifically bootstrap to design the website for their annual\n            competitions.\n          </div>\n          <h3>Technical Skills</h3>\n          <div className=\"w-p\">\n            Technical skills I have experience with include the following:\n            <p style={{ fontStyle: \"italic\" }}>\n              HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Library: React.js), Python, Java and\n              Microsoft Excel (VBA, Macros, Pivot Tables, Lookups)\n            </p>\n            My work with these skills can be demonstrated through the various\n            projects I have. Recently, I have been interested in JavaScript and\n            am working on developing a better knowledge of the library React.js\n            and the framework Node.js.\n          </div>\n          <h3>Education</h3>\n          <div className=\"w-p\">\n            I often get asked, “Why management engineering?”, “What do\n            management engineers even do?”.

We\n            focus on efficiency and effectiveness when analyzing management\n            systems. Management engineering is often compared to industrial\n            engineering, as the two programs are very similar in terms of the\n            courses we take. The main difference includes management engineering\n            having a greater focus on information and software systems than\n            traditional industrial engineering programs.\n          </div>\n          <h3>Future</h3>\n          <div className=\"w-p\">\n            As I begin my professional career, I hope to explore various tech\n            domains and work in different teams to become a more well-rounded\n            student.
